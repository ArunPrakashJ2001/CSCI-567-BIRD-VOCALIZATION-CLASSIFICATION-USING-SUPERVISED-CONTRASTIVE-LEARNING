# CSCI-567-BIRD-VOCALIZATION-CLASSIFICATION-USING-SUPERVISED-CONTRASTIVE-LEARNING
Birds, vital indicators of environmental health, require accurate identification through calls for effective monitoring. Our study enhances this using supervised contrastive learning with deep CNN architectures on mel-spectrograms. Objective: improve training convergence.
